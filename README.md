# Portfolify

Welcome to Portfolify, an innovative app designed specifically for high schoolers to craft their portfolios based on their high school experiences.

## Overview

Portfolify revolves around the concept of simplicity, denoted by the logo, which serves as a visual cue throughout the user interface. The app features a cohesive color scheme inspired by the logo, creating a visually appealing experience.

## MVVM Architecture

### Model
The Model in Portfolify represents the underlying data and business logic of the application. This includes user profiles, portfolio information, login credentials, and other relevant data. It manages the application's state, enforces business rules, and interacts with external data sources.

### View
The View encompasses the user interface elements that users interact with, such as screens, buttons, and text fields. It presents data from the ViewModel to the user and handles user interactions.

### ViewModel
The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the View and the Model. It exposes properties and commands for the View to bind to, handles user interactions, and fetches data from the Model.
